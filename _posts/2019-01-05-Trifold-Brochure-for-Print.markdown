alt: Fountain Valley Karate Brochure
project-date: January 2019
client: Fountain Valley Karate
category: Print Media & UX Design
description: This sales brochure was designed to drive inbound traffic to the Karate Fountain Valley dojo, specifically parents looking to enroll their kids in some sort of fitness program. 


            For this reason I wanted to deliver a modern looking flyer akin to gyms, kickboxing clubs, etc., but with a flare of ancient Chinese and Japanese culture to give it an edge that matched the current style of the dojo.


            The business owner needed something for people to pick up in his front entryway, so it needed to be eye catching. Mainly, my aim was to deliver a message to the parents that Fountain Valley Karate is a safe place for their children to grow in areas such as confidence, discipline, respect, and most importantly, focus.  Comradery and friendship were also important to bring up as well, ultimately painting a picture in the parents' minds of their child succeeding at Karate Fountain Valley.


            Created with Affinity Designer, I started by drafting up a rough mockup outlining where the information is to be placed and showcasing the theme I plan to go with. I went back and forth with the owner, doing test prints and revising the content until we were both happy with it. A PDF version of the final brochure was delivered upon approval, which was then taken to a local print shop for production.
