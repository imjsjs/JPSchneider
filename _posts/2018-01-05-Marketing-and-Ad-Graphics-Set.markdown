description: Following the introduction of a new line of Microsoft products, it is imperative for software retailers to get the word out that they have the biggest inventory and the lowest prices. Because of this, Wy Choice Software asked me to design marketing graphics for their website, google ads and email campaigns that the team would be running.


        Being that Office 2019 is a product with a huge team of designers already behind it, it was important for me to stay true to the design standards already put in place by Microsoft.
        
        
        The challenge here was incorporating Wy Choice Software's style in with Microsoft's without deviating too far. To accomplish this, I created a design that features the new products, but with a subtle hint of Wy Choice Software's branding to suggest that they are closely tied to Microsoft and their business. A subtle dose of brand colors from the individuals apps (word, excel, powerpoint, etc.) is splashed above to signify the breadth of software included in the suite.
