description: This sales brochure was designed to drive inbound traffic to the Karate Fountain Valley dojo, specifically parents looking to enroll their kids in some sort of fitness program. 


            For this reason I wanted to deliver a modern looking flyer akin to gyms, kickboxing clubs, etc., but with a flare of ancient Chinese and Japanese culture to give it an edge that matched the current style of the dojo.


            The business owner needed something to leave out for people to pick up on their own, so it was important to convince onlookers up front that this was something worth looking at. To accomplish this, I included a high quality photo of three kids striking perfect karate stances, allowing for parents to get a quick impression of what their child could be like if they were a part of the studio.


            For the rest of the brochure, my aim was to visually deliver a message to the parents that Fountain Valley Karate is a safe place for their children to grow in areas such as confidence, discipline, respect, and most importantly, focus.  Comradery and friendship were also important to bring up as well, ultimately painting a picture in the parents' minds of their child succeeding at Karate Fountain Valley.
