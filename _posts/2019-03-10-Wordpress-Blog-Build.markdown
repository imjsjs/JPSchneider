description: My Choice Software is a volume license wholesaler and retailer of Microsoft products. The team was in need of a good looking site to feature their blog articles and boost their SEO rankings.


            The main design points were to improve readability and accessibilty of the articles, while maintaining a consistent look between all of the pages and content. Many of the articles had been written by various authors over the course of a few years, so there were massive inconsitencies in their markup that needed to be dealt with by the code.


            It was also important to make the site be compatible with phones and tablets, with the goal of improving retention rates for their mobile traffic and encourage more people to consume the brand on various devices.
