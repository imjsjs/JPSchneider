description: Following the introduction of Microsoft's Office 2019 line of software, it was important that my company be at the forefront of the market with the newest products. Because of this, I was asked to design marketing graphics for the website, google ads and email campaigns that the team would be running.


        Being that Office 2019 is a product with a huge team of designers already behind it, it was important for me to stay true to the standards already put in place by Microsoft. 
        
        
        The challenge here was incorporating my company's style in with Microsoft's without deviating too far. To accomplish this, I created a design that features the new products, but with a subtle hint of my company's branding to suggest that they are closely tied to Microsoft and their business.
