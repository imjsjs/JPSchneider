description: For this project I prototyped a new style of dating app - one that is more engaging and fun for the users.


            To do so, I had to put myself in the perspective of single individuals looking to meet new people. Dating is inherantly awkward, so what are some of the "ice-breakers" that people do to ease the tension?

            
            Some of the ideas were to include games, such as Truth-or-Dare, that potential matches could play with eachother.  However, the most note-worthy idea which I ended up prototyping is the inclusion of a "Spark" feature, which is essentially a guided, voice-only chat service. 


            The idea was based on research showing that people make stronger relationships communicating with their voices as opposed to pure text. Users would be prompted to send a "Spark" to someone they like, and if the respondant likes what they hear, they can send a "Spark" back!
