alt: Product Page Redesign Composition
project-date: May 2018
client: Floor City
category: Web UI/UX Design
description: This project was for a client with a Shopify store that wanted to improve the look of their product pages. 


            The client's key points for this redesign were to create a full-screen view for their customers on very large screens, with a 'sticky' fixed-header feature to ensure the add-to-cart button is always within view. 

            
            Included in the deliverables were compositions of the full product page as well as the product page with the fixed-header. I also included compositions of the same design for smaller laptop screens to ensure the client understood what the site would look like in a responsive manner.
